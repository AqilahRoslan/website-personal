<center><p4>My last feature is I able to write and converse in basic Korean. I have a lot of interest in Korea language so I decide to learn Korean on my own because it's costly to take a Korean class. I learn Korean language through internet website, watching Korean Drama and also listening to Korean songs. This below button probably can be a help for you to learn Korean effectively. </p4> </center>
